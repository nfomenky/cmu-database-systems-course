# cmu-database-systems-course
This course is on the design and implementation of database management systems from the CMU Database Group.
Topics include data models (relational, document, key/value), storage models (n-ary, decomposition), query languages (SQL, stored procedures), storage architectures (heaps, log-structured), indexing (order preserving trees, hash tables), transaction processing (ACID, concurrency control), recovery (logging, checkpoints), query processing (joins, sorting, aggregation, optimization), and parallel architectures (multi-core, distributed). Case studies on open-source and commercial database systems will be used to illustrate these techniques and trade-offs. The course is appropriate for students with strong systems programming skills.

All credits to Professor Andy Pavlo at Carnegie Mellon and and his team at the Database Group. For more information on this course visit:
